# Lumia Firmware Download Bot
A Telegram bot to download, upload, and request firmware for Lumia devices.

Recently, the Lumia firmware software repository server went down unexpectedly (unexpectedly? Not really :P). As a result, this bot was created to preserve all existing `Full Flash Update (FFU)` files by supporting sharing and contributions to a single repository.

### User commands:
* start - Start the bot.
* download - Download the firmware for your Lumia device.
* upload - Upload your firmware to the repository.
* request - Request to add firmware to the download list.
* administrators - Manage the bot.
* cancel - Cancel any pending action.

### Admin commands:
* list_admins - Display the list of admins.
* get_id - Retrieve the user ID of a user.
* get_info - Retrieve the user info of a user.
* block_user - Block a user from using the bot.
* unblock_user - Unblock a user from using the bot.
* blocked_users - Display the list of blocked users.

### Super admin commands:
* add_admin - Promote a user to admin privileges.
* remove_admin - Demote a user from admin privileges.
* text_user - Send a message to a bot user.
