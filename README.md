# Lumia Firmware Download Bot
A Telegram bot to download, upload, and request firmware for Lumia devices.

Recently, the Lumia firmware software repository server went down unexpectedly (unexpectedly? Not really :P). As a result, this bot was created to preserve all existing `Full Flash Update (FFU)` files by supporting sharing and contributions to a single repository.

#### commands:
* start - Start the bot.
* download - Download the firmware for your Lumia device.
* upload - Upload your firmware to the repository.
* request - Request to add firmware to the download list.
* administrators - Manage the bot.
* cancel - Cancel any pending action.
